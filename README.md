# How to use a test driven approach when creating a project using Python.

1. Identify the first piece of functionality that needs to be built
2. Write a test for this feature
3. Run the test - it should fail
4. Write the code to make your test pass
5. Refactor your code (i.e. look at ways to make the code you have written 'simpler' or 'cleaner')
6. Repeat step 1 to 6 for every new feature. Each new feature should pass every test you've written up until that point
